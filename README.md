The importance of reading to children cannot be underestimated. Reading for pleasure can benefit a child's education, social and cognitive development, well-being, and mental health. The effect of reading on a child's development is significant. Research by BookTrust has discovered the profound benefits of reading for child development, facilitating social interaction between adults and children, and encouraging children to interact with the world around them.
